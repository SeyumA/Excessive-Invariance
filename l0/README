The code in this folder is for generating and evaluating invariance-based adversarial examples under the 0-norm on MNIST.
The `automate.py` file can be used to automatically generate adversarial examples for 100 random MNIST test points 
(the indices of these 100 points is specified in the notebook).
This folder will, in the near future, contain saved numpy arrays for pre-generated examples.
